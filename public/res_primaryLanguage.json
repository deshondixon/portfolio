      "description": "Hey! Iâ€™m DeShon Dixon. A US Army Veteran, I've recently transitioned into software development. The languages I utilize the most are JavaScript and Python. What I bring to a team is that Iâ€™m very coachable, eager to learn, and easy to work with. Iâ€™ve always worked jobs that involve me finding solutions for customer needs and have a strong passion for problem solving. Iâ€™ve worked in sales, video editing, and as a mechanic in the army and they have always been favored because I listen with empathy and ensure expectations are met. Iâ€™m able to hold my own because Iâ€™m willing to listen to advice. I love to hear opinions on how I could be more effective. I strive to learn more and handle ambiguity well. Iâ€™m self-starting and continually find ways to be productive. Iâ€™m a team player and put the greater good of the team before individual gain. I own up to anything I am wrong in. I never make excuses or hide my mistakes. I do what it takes to correct those mistakes and learn from them.",

The application is built using a combination of technologies, including React, Node.js, and Express.js for the frontend and backend development, respectively. Bootstrap is used for the layout and styling of the application, while MongoDB is used as the database to store user information and image requests. CSS3 is used to create custom styles and enhance the visual appearance of the application. To ensure secure authentication, the application uses Auth0 to manage user login and authorization. Once logged in, users can use the Dall-E 2 API to input a prompt and generate an image based on their request. The API uses state-of-the-art machine learning models to generate high-quality images that accurately reflect the user's prompt. OpenImg is a powerful and convenient tool for anyone interested in generating custom images using artificial intelligence. Whether you're a designer looking for inspiration or simply someone who enjoys exploring the creative possibilities of AI, OpenImg has something to offer.",

There is also a drop down menu that allows the user to search by the amount of horns an animal has to narrow down their search. First, I decided to use React as the framework for my project because of its versatility and ability to efficiently render components. I also used JavaScript and CSS to add interactivity and styling to the project. Next, I began by setting up the basic structure of the app and creating the components that would be necessary, such as the gallery and the drop down menu. I also gathered a list of horned animals and their respective images and information that I wanted to include in the gallery. Once the basic structure was in place, I began implementing the functionality for the drop down menu. This involved adding the search functionality and handling the user's input to filter the gallery accordingly. Next, I focused on styling the app to make it visually appealing and easy to navigate. This involved adding custom CSS styles and ensuring that the layout was responsive and looked good on different devices. Finally, I tested the app thoroughly to ensure that it was functioning correctly and made any necessary adjustments. Once I was satisfied with the result, I deployed the app and made it available for users to view and interact with via netlify.",

I utilized React for the front-end of the game, allowing for a smooth and interactive user experience. The game logic was implemented using JavaScript, and the overall design and styling was achieved through the use of CSS. Overall, it was a great opportunity for me to further enhance my skills in these technologies and create a fun and engaging game for players.",

I had to consider various factors such as user experience and efficiency while designing and building the system. I also had to ensure that the system was user-friendly and easy to navigate. Overall, Snakes Cafe is a useful tool for anyone looking to manage a restaurant or food service business. It helps streamline the process of taking orders, making it easier for customers to enjoy their dining experience. I am proud of the work I put into creating this utility, and I hope it will be a valuable resource for others in the industry.",

Players take turns rolling six dice, trying to score as many points as possible by rolling certain combinations. The goal is to reach a total of 10,000 points before your opponents. Developing Ten-thousand was a fun and rewarding experience for me. I enjoyed designing the game mechanics and implementing them in Python. The process required a lot of trial and error, but it was worth it to see the final product come to life. I hope that Ten-thousand brings as much joy and entertainment to others as it did for me while creating it. Give it a try and see if you have what it takes to be the ultimate Ten-thousand champion!",
