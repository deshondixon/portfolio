      "description": "I am DeShon Dixon. US Army Veteran transitioning into software development. The transition into Software development has been hard but the life I've lived has been harder. I have chosen to transition into software development because I wanted a career where my work is meaningful and I can see the results of my hard work. I have struggled financially my whole life and it has fueled my drive throughout this transition. I know a career in software development would allow me to break the cycle and elevate me to a better position in life. I'm tired of just being another body at a job and easily expendable. Switching to a career in software development is my first time doing something I want to do in life. I've had nothing but dead end jobs other than the military. The military was a stepping stone for me to get out of the position I was in life and give me a chance I would've never otherwise had. The experience I've gained while in the military has instilled the ability to adapt in self-starting and collaborative environments.",
